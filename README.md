# WarehouseWreckage
This is my first game.

I am on a journey to learn game design/development, and this has been my first project.

Warehouse Wreckage is a simple chaos shooter, with very basic projectile system, limited ammo, and nice collision physics.
The goal of this game was to learn the basics of level design and Blueprints.

Fingers crossed.
